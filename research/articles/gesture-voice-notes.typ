- Reading Over GestureVoice it feels like the niche that VoiceProse could fill is in making it easy to write long pieces of prose for school work and the like. This is leaning towards a google doc extension.

- Like GestureVoice I would want to review related work on text editing for users with decreased hand mobility.

- Khan et al, speech bassed text editing system

- Do a preliminary study

- A preliminary study with the struggles of those with limited hand mobility in writing long form essays

- How would I go about measuring the impact of VoiceProse?
