= Reading Through Talon Hmmmm

- It feels like whatever I decide to explore in text editing will be well treaded territory. Simple writing of prose with your voice isn't an interesting problem nor a problem at all. I could find some subset of people where that is a problem for, e.g completely blind participants? Especially because when it comes down to it, there are only a couple of things you need to do to write text.

- Applying modal text editing to speech is not simply that useful.

- I have more ironed out what Voice Prose would supposedly be: Apply a vim-like modal text editing with voice for writing prose. The issue is that modal text editing is overkill for the couple of things you need to do.

- An extreme form of text entering where using using your head and blinks, you can select letters like on a flip phone, where the final word is entered using your gaze.

- Reading the text your gazing at

- A simple USB stick loaded with a simple operating system that can be controlled with your voice

- Maybe I could work on improving recognition accuracy?

- Talon is hard to use mayhaps I could do something to make it easier?

- Ohhh head movement is also an option
