= Research For Voice Prose

It's feeling like prose writing using your voice is a well-treaded topic. The
modal (command vs insert mode, for instance to differentiate between
commands and when to insert text) is not necessary.


The google docs voice to text introduces rudimentary commands that seem to be adequate for prosee writing. Is there a different niche I could target? GestureVoice uses a multimodal approach with a smart watch, voice to text, and voice commands to help blind users send primarily texts on their phone. Could I use a multi-modal approach to target a different niche?

GestureVoice uses regular text to speech. Then a knob with selectable granularities to navigate to an error dictating exactly whats being passed. And then simple commands to fix typos.

== Outside of Academia
- Dragon Professional Naturally Speaking Software (expensive). The reason (as far as I can tell) that dragon is expensive is because they have a proprietary model for converting speech to text thats the best in the business.

- Google Docs Voice To Text introduces rudimentary commands

- Talon: "Powerful hands-free input replacement". Talon contains many
  different parts like voice control, eye tracking, and a noise recognition system. https://talonvoice.com/docs/#

- Cursorless: Manipulation of text, intended for coding, using a defined
  language. Built on top of Talon.

- A custom built system of coding using voice because of RSI:

- Obviously regular text to speech programs like in google docs.

== Dragon Professional Software

- Just really good dictation software?
