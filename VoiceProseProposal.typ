== Introduction

From going over a couple research articles, I've come to the conclusion that
the initial idea for Voice Prose is needlessly complicated and is a solution in
search of a problem. I still wish to research computer accessibility of text
inputs but would be willing to switch topics. Voice Prose is going to evolve,
either designing a software solution around a specific demographic of people
(e.g low sighted, mute, etc) or a general one and then testing its
effectiveness in the same manner as previous similar work? I plan to talk with
the DDAA president Ella and an ARC Director to search for problems.

== Related Work

- GestureVoice: Uses a multi-modal approach to improve error correction speed in low-sighted individuals. 
- Gestures and Widgets: Using a set of finger gestures to encode specific text manipulations on touchscreens to speed up typing text while reducing cognitive load.

== Research Questions

- How effective is [an alternative mode] of input [for a specific demographic]

== Methods

- Wizard Of Oz session to figure out what the resulting software should be
- After writing the software, another session will be conducted but with the real software
- Some statistical (?) method in order to determine whether the software actually helped

== Timeline
- Dr. Currin is going to IDC from May 18th to the 21st

- I would choose the 8 week option from May 25th to July 17th to avoid clashing with IDC

- Need to confirm Dr. Currin would be around for weeks 1, 2, 7, and 8. Those
  are the important weeks I would need help.

- Week 1, May 25th to May 31st: Preliminary Study to measure how well text is inputted by my target group of people
- Week 2, June 1st to June 7th: Wizard Of Oz study to figure out the best features for the software
- Week 3 - 6, June 8th to June 28th: Development of the software necessary
- Week 7 - 8, June 29th to July 17th: Another session to measure the effectiveness of the software and compare it to the previous measured baseline

== Future

- Start the IRB ?
- Finding Partipcants for my study?
- Further research to figure out a text input method?
- Methods: The specific statistical methods for the study
- The questions to ask for the preliminary session?
- The questions to ask for the Wizard Of Oz session?
- The questions to ask for the final session?
- The method by which the software would be coded (i.e roughly how would I go about it)

I plan to do further research this weekend to hammer down an alternative input
method. And then schedule another meeting before winter break to focus my
efforts during Winter Break.
