== Introduction

From going over a couple research articles, I've come to the conclusion that
the initial idea for Voice Prose is needlessly complicated and is a solution in
search of a problem. I still wish to research computer accessibility of text
inputs but would be willing to switch topics. Voice Prose is going to evolve,
either designing a software solution around a specific demographic of people
(e.g low sighted, mute, etc) or a general one and then testing its
effectiveness in the same manner as previous similar work?

== Related Work

- GestureVoice: Uses a multi-modal approach to improve error correction speed in low-sighted individuals. 

== Research Questions

- How effective is [an alternative mode] of input [for a specific demographic]

== Methods

- Wizard Of Oz session to figure out what the resulting software should be
- After writing the software, another session will be conducted but with the real software
- Some statistical (?) method in order to determine whether the software actually helped

== Timeline
- Dr. Currin is going to IDC from May 18th to the 21st

- I would choose the 8 week option from May 25th to July 17th to avoid clashing with IDC

- Week 1: Preliminary Study to measure how well text is inputted by my target group of people
- Week 2: Wizard Of Oz study to figure out the best features for the software
- Week 3 - 5: Development of the software necessary
- Week 6 - 7: Another session to measure the effectiveness of the software and compare it to the previous measured baseline
- Week 8: Modifying software

== Bibliography

== Future

- How to start the IRB?
- Finding Partipcants for my study?

I plan to do further research this weekend to hammer down an alternative input
method. And then schedule another meeting before winter break to focus my
efforts during Winter Break.
